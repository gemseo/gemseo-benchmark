"""Class that generates performance measures out of data generated by an algorithm.

Iterative algorithms that solve, for example, optimization problems or equations
produce histories of data such as the value of the objective to minimize,
or the size of the equation residual, at each iteration.
The best value obtained up until each iteration can be generated out of this data.
Here we call "performance history" the history of the best values obtained up until
each iteration.

Infeasible data can be discarded based upon histories of infeasibility measures or
boolean feasibility statuses.

Performance histories can be used to generate target values for a problem,
or to generate the data profile of an algorithm.

                An infeasibility measure is a non-negative real number representing
                the gap between the design and the feasible space,
                a zero value meaning feasibility.

                then the infeasibility measures are set to zero in case of feasibility,
                and set to infinity otherwise.

                then every infeasibility measure is set to zero.
            feasibility_statuses: The history of the (boolean) feasibility statuses.
