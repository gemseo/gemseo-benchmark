"""Computation of target values out of algorithms performance histories.

Consider a problem to be solved by an iterative algorithm,
e.g. an optimization problem or a root-finding problem.
Targets are values,
i.e. values of the objective function or values of the residual norm,
ranging from a first acceptable value to the best known value for the problem.
Targets are used to estimate the efficiency
(relative to the number of problem functions evaluations)
of an algorithm to solve a problem (or several)
and computes its data profile (see :mod:`data_profile`).
