# Changelog

All notable changes of this project will be documented here.

The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0)
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

# Develop

## Added

### Benchmarker

- The option ``log_gemseo_to_file`` has been added to ``Benchmarker.execute``
  and ``Scenario.execute`` to save the GEMSEO log of each algorithm execution
  to a file in the same directory as its performance history file.

# Version 2.0.0 (December 2023)

## Changed

### Benchmarker

- The option to automatically save the logs of pSeven has been removed
  from classes ``Scenario`` and ``Benchmarker``.
  However, the user can still save these logs
  by passing an instance-specific option to ``AlgorithmConfiguration``
  (refer to the "Added" section of the present changelog).
  For example:
  ``instance_algorithm_options
  ={"log_path": lambda problem, index: f"my/log/files/{problem.name}.{index}.log"}``.
  N.B. the user is now responsible for the creation of the parent directories.
- Class ``Worker`` no longer sets ``PerformanceHistory.doe_size``
  to the length of the value of the pSeven option ``"sample_x"``.
  Note that this does not affect the behavior of ``gemseo-benchmark``:
  ``PerformanceHistory.doe_size`` is only used as convenience
  when loading/saving a ``PerformanceHistory`` using a file.
  In particular, the behavior of ``Report`` is not changed.
  The user can still set the value of ``PerformanceHistory.doe_size``
  by themselves since it is a public attribute.

## Added

- Support for Python 3.11.

### Algorithms

- Algorithm options specific to problem instances (e.g. paths for output files)
  can be passed to ``AlgorithmConfiguration`` in the new argument ``instance_algorithm_options``.

### Benchmarker

- One can get the path to a performance history file with ``Benchmarker.get_history_path``.

## Removed

- Support for Python 3.8.

# Version 1.1.0 (September 2023)

## Added

### Results

- The names of functions and the number of variables are stored in the
    performance history files.

### Report

- The optimization histories can be displayed on a logarithmic scale.

### Scenario

- The options `custom_algos_descriptions` and
    `max_eval_number_per_group` of `Report`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"} can be passed through `Scenario`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"}.

## Fixed

### Report

- The sections of the PDF report are correctly numbered.
- The graphs of the PDF report are anchored to their expected
    locations.

# Version 1.0.0 (June 2023)

First version.
